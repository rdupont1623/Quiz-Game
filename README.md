# Quiz-Game

This project was a lot more than I could handle. I made this quiz with my friend Sean, who works as a Front End Web Developer at a start up in Portsmouth.  He had made this exact quiz while in college, so he watched me make it on Zoom and gave me advice on the way. Although I learned a lot about local storage and javascript classes, I bit off more than I could chew on this one. It was good experience though working on a project that required me to reference so many different html, css, and js. sheets. Sean's quiz did not have a timer on it, I intend to revisit this project over the few weeks and add one. I could not manage to get the "save" button to work properly. If you click save, it boots you to a part of the files storage. If you go look at the leader board through the index link though, it still saves your score.
